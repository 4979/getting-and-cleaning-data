## Course Project

**Coursera Online Course: Getting and Cleaning Data** - Peer Assessments

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

**Descriptions of Project Work**

This "README.md" file describes how "run_analysis.R" script works to analyse the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

**Step:01**
unzip the data from given URL "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" and rename the folder with "data".

**Step:02**

created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
